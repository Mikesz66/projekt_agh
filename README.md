## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `uv` (The Python package installer)
- gcc ?

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This single command will create a Python virtual environment, install all required packages.

```bash
make setup
```

After it finishes, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Download and Process Data

This command will download the necessary raw datasets and run the processing scripts to generate the final `search_db.csv` and `display_db.csv`.

```bash
make data
```

## Usage

To run the main application:

```bash
make run
```

To run the test suite:

```bash
make test
```

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed data (Generated by `make data`, ignored by Git).
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts for downloading and processing data.
- `src/`: Main Python application source code.
- `tests/`: All automated tests.

## Backend

### Data Structure:
- id: int
- avg_rating: float
- review_count: int
- minutes: int
- cal: float
- prot: float
- fat: float
- name_clean: str
- ingredients_serialized: str [list separated by `;`]
- tags_serialized: str [list separated by `;`]

### Input: (Everything is optional)
The input should be a JSON array of objects, structured similarly to the `Data Structure` above. Example fields you might include:
- `name`: str
- `minutes`: int (note: if it's a number for calculations, `int` is better than `str`)
- `tags`: list[str]
- etc...

### Output:
The output will be a JSON array of objects, each containing an `id` and its calculated `accuracy`.

```json
[
  {"id": 123, "accuracy": 0.987},
  {"id": 456, "accuracy": 0.952},
  {"id": 789, "accuracy": 0.991}
]
```
